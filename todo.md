# Todo list
Some ideias to make the application better.

- [x] Add head title on game pages;
- [x] Add a favicon;
- [x] Fix the rating problems on game pages;
- [x] Use AlpineJS in npm instead of CDN;
- [] Refactor the "formatGameForView". We need to make that reusable;
- [] Refactor some components like modals (for trailers and screenshots);
- [] Some old games does not have all the complete informations making the app crashes or layout breaks;
